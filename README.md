# Homework 1
 
The homework is due on Thursday the 4th of November at 4:00 pm. 

The topics that you will be assessed on are:

- Assignment of variables
- Types of variables
- Basic functions (print, len, input)
- If/elif/else statements
- While/for loops

5% of the grade is automatically assigned upon submission through github classroom. 
All the exercises have the same weight (i.e., they all have the same value when it comes to the final grade of the assessment).

Each exercise will be evaluated with one of the following 5 scores: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1.
The criteria to assign each score are as follows:

0.00 - The student has not attempted to solve the exercise or missed the point entirely (e.g., blank page or solved something unrelated to the question).

0.25 - The student has attempted to solve the exercise but, either there is a logical error in the program (e.g., wrote something but it wouldn't solve the problem) or the program is largely incomplete.

0.50 - The student has understood the logic but there is some major bugs, the program does not work for some inputs or the program is incomplete. This score is also assigned for programs that execute as intended but in a very inefficient way (for instance, using a very long list of if statements when the problem could be solved easily with a loop).

0.75 - The student has understood the logic and the program would work aside from some minor bugs. The appropriate methods to solve the problem have been used.

1.00 - The program works flawlessly and the appropriate methods to solve it have been used.
